All after a major corruption scandal, unmet fiscal promises, and policy that alienated the west; Trudeau still came out on top on a 2019 Monday night with minority control of the house all after what many Canadians called a battle of “evil versus evil.” But how did we get here? A government accused of corruption and obstruction of justice being democratically re-elected with a record high voter turnout rate.</div>
<br />
In 2019, Canadian’s aged between 18 and 38 represented just under 40% of the eligible voter population (Source: Adacus Data). This meant this group has sweeping power on deciding the fate of the election. Yet treated like kids that aren’t mature enough to be a part of the conversation by a major political party.<br />
<br />
A lack of vigilance with words among a variety of social issues and their apparent coexistence with his faith, citizenship drama, climate change ignorance are just a few metrics of Scheer’s failure to score a goal in an empty net. Why is the party still going off ideals written in the mid to late 1900s? What, to appease it’s largely white, male, and uneducated voter base? To continue culture and tradition. To spread the love of faith to Canadians. To make Canada great again. None of the above. A clear failure to target to voters in the GTA and Quebec area; those who decide the fate of the election and government.<br />
<br />
No conversation on the elimination of poverty, a war on climate change, increasing meaningful employment for university graduates, challenging racial hate crime, achieving affordable housing for all, and an open policy on celebrating diversity. All of which are crucial in the conversation to young Canadians, and all of which are addressed in the platforms of every other major party. The resentment of youth is the feeling of being left out of the conversation and being treated as ‘immature kids.’ This all weakens the party which already needs to fight an existing uphill battle of rewriting the connotated definition of ‘conservative.’<br />
<br />
What’s next for the party? The choice of a leader who vows as a social and economic conservative and markets his platform as significantly to the right of Liberals or a leader who advertises himself as open, socially forward, and slightly centre to the Liberals. This decision will lead to either another defeat or regained leadership.<br />
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default">
<strong>It’s clear if O’Toole is to be leader, another Scheer-like failure will again dominate the headlines</strong></blockquote>
<!-- wp:paragraph --><br />
Universal acceptance of diversity is not a policy, a perspective or an opinion to young voters, is assumed. Climate change similarly something our generation will have to fight like how our ancestors fought in world war II. Ambiguity on the commitment to ensure no Canadian’s existence is at question is again going to lead to the defeat of the conservatives if O’Toole were to win.<br />
<br />
An article: “Where 14 Conservative leadership candidates stand on social issues” (CTV News, Dehaas, 2017) pinpoints the lack of unity of the Conservative Party of Canada. Abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, and doctor assisted death were all discussed in the article. With no unified message from mid-level and leading party MPs. With some saying they “choose to not reopen the debate” and would not provide their perspective on the issue. These exact words prove to Canadians, they will not take responsibility on issues that profoundly affect Canadians.<br />
<br />
Canadian’s don’t want change; they want a clear answer. Something the conservative Party of Canada has failed to provide Canadians.<br />
