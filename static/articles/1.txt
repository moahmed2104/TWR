<p>I crescendoed my voice, loud and clear.
Waiting for the mountains to respond to and mimic the shrill in my voice.

</p><p>I run across the gravel road, wide enough for two people to strut along,
</p><p>The mustard plants greeting me as I skip and breathe in the faint smell of newly cut grass,
</p><p>A delightful, sweet treat for the cattle, stowed away for the upcoming ruthless winter.

</p><br><p>I crane my neck to scour for the familiar wisps of smoke coming from the chimneys in the
Nearby kothis (huts),
</p><p>A sign of preparations underway for the evening supper, a feast decorated with makki di roti
(bread of maize) and homemade butter, freshly strained from buttermilk gifted by the cattle.
</p><p>Beautiful, golden honey served alongside noon chai (pink tea), the perfect accompaniment
</p><p>To give the day a rest.

</p><br><p>As the sun hides behind the mighty peaks of the Karakoram range,
</p><p>the mountains cast a shadow over the sheltered valley,
</p><p>Promising to protect her children who found refuge in her colossal boundaries.

</p><br><p>The children usher the tyres with their sticks inside the house as nightfall approaches,
</p><p>Climbing its way across the lofty peaks,
</p><p>embedding itself into the crevices and coveting the valley softly below.

</p><br><p>I steal glances with the nightly sky,
</p><p>speckled with stars so bright as though a child using glitter had unleashed her complete creativity.
</p><p>As I pan across the sky, my awestruck thoughts at the glimpses of marvel are interrupted by hoots of a distant owl and the incessant flow of the Kishanganga river,
</p><p>Harbouring waters from falling tears of melting glaciers and gushing hot geysers.

</p><br><p>Quietness blankets the lush green pastures as darkness sheathes every house,
</p><p>a reminder to onlookers of the aloof shrieks that lose their way amidst the mountains.
</p><p>To this heaven, demarcated with barbed wires, I give my last breath.
</p><p>Let the tulips graze every conscience till the tugging of sleeves, at last, pulls them to gape in full view at the valley in between the mountains.
