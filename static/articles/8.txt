Caring for the environment is essential for future sustainability but it also affects our everyday lives. Pollution can negatively impact your health and being in nature is shown to improve your mood. Making sure that the world is healthy is something that everyone should be conscious of in their daily lives.<br />
So you may be wondering how you can help. It doesn't take a zero waste lifestyle to reduce your carbon footprint. I know that many tips on how to help the earth may seem daunting but this collection of tips can help you on your journey to live a sustainable and minimal lifestyle.<br />
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Eat less meat and animal products. This doesn't mean that you need to go vegan but limiting your meat and animal product consumption to fewer days a week can make a large difference. The cattle industry contributes 18% of man made greenhouse gas emissions, that's more than the entire transportation industry. Meat production also limits biodiversity in the natural environment with more and more animals being domesticated. (Not to mention the unethical treatment of these animals). Reducing your intake of meat is also super easy and you can still enjoy your favorite meals with meat tasting substitutes. Like I said you don’t have to be vegan but maybe go for beans instead of beef every once and awhile.</li>

<li>Buy used clothes, donate old clothes and repair damaged clothes. There are lots of reasons for why the clothing industry is a burden on the environment. The production of cotton uses up large amounts of water. Each shirt takes up 2700 litres of water to produce. Additionally cotton takes the largest amount of pesticides to grow of all the crops, the use of land continuously for commercial farming can leave the land arid and unusable for the future. The production of clothing is also very machine heavy. The human labour used to sew garments it's also widely unethical with the existence of sweatshops, ill treatment of workers and low pay. Clothing is also almost never produced locally (unless you live in developing countries like Bangladesh or China) and thus needs to be shipped worldwide. This accounts for large amounts of carbon emissions, in fact 10% of carbon emissions world wide. All of these issues can be easily mitigated by your actions. Buying used clothing can reduce the demand for new clothing which in turn relieves the stress on our natural resources.&nbsp; With the rise of fast fashion things go out of style quickly and new clothing is always in demand. You can help change this by choosing to buy only when you need and also extending a garment’s lifetime by donating it when you are done with it so that someone else may use it. This not only helps others but also keeps perfectly good clothing out of landfills. Finally repairing small holes rather than scraping a piece of clothing means that you can use it longer and thus reduce your carbon footprint little by little. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiSYoeqb_VY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiSYoeqb_VY</a></li>
