On Sunday April 19, 2020 a Reuters report outlined a multi-billion-dollar bankruptcy declaration by America’s largest luxury department store. This was after a $5.7 Million USD bond payment was left unpaid earlier that week. With over $6 billion in liabilities to dozens of investors including the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, who oversees the investment and management of CPP payments.<br />

Analysts say, “We continue to view its capital structure as unsustainable.”</blockquote>
With many analysts claiming it’s credit score is deep into “junk” territory. Neiman Marcus Group LTD LLC reported a $31.2 million loss in the third quarter of their 2019 fiscal year, with losses up from last years $19.9 million loss in the same quarter (Bloomberg, 2019).

But we must recognize a pattern of large department stores and a pattern of weak profits and strong headwinds they’re facing in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. J. C. Penny, Hudson’s Bay Company, Eaton’s, Zellers, Sears, and Macy’s have all announced either cuts or have completely gone under in what many are calling a “retail apocalypse.”<br />

A message for department stores; you have months to save your brand image, not quarters or years. We’re talking months to be able to win over young consumers before you’re forgotten. Choose not to, your days are numbered.<br />
