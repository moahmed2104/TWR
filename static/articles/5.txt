<br />
The city seems peculiarly quiet,<br />
The roads have become an abode of peace,<br />
Nature is nurturing,<br />
But at grim cost,<br />
We must call it an apocalypse<br />
or fate,<br />
Freedom and liberty are now<br />
Lost,<br />
But people still preaching hate,<br />
We are desirous to end our sorrows,<br />
But, I guess, we would risk our lives again tomorrow,<br />
We must seek to eradicate it all,<br />
Because it's our temporary solutions that are the root cause of sorrow,<br />
Let's hope everything will get well soon,<br />
And we again could see the wheat fields glittering by the shine of the moon.<br />
