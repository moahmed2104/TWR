<em>At the Cusp of the hour,<br />There are the flames of the sea that reside in our vicinity,<br />We as the kings and queens of our domains,<br />Why do we reside in silence?<br />Like the calm before the storm,<br />Why do we lay on the seashore?<br />And endure the waves of despicable actions,<br />Actions beyond the realm of tranquility,<br />The silent ones aid in the aggravation,<br />In discrimination, racism, casteism, sexism,<br />The blind faith and the deep-rooted regressive mindsets<br />Of every morsel of sand on the seashores,</em><br />
<br />
<em>Don’t let it encapsulate your thoughts,<br />Let go of the fear you once held in the firm grip of societal pressure,<br />Let it go like the wind,<br />The remedy is the voice that is embedded,<br />The robust voice every morsel of sand possesses in this seashore,<br />The fierce voice that shrieks free from the shackles of reservations,<br />Be Opinionated, hold dynamic thoughts and ideas,<br />Let out the message with crispness and clarity,<br />Be an inspiration instead of leading a life with desperation,<br />Don’t showcase benevolence to the waves,<br />Live like a free bird over the horizon,<br />With the personality of a lion,</em><br />

<em>In the end of it all,<br />We must put an end to the societal norms and regressive mindsets,<br />The current is strong, yet the waves are narrow and shallow,<br />Keep your emotions to a piece,<br />Be a Vivid dreamer and hold a hand to your heart and believe,<br />At the end of the wave,<br />There is always a beautiful sky</em><br />
